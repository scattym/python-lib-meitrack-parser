2.0 (2018-09-02)
----------------

- Change the ordering of the bits processed in the AAA command. Bit ordering is reversed compared to the C01 command.


1.15 (2018-09-01)
-----------------

- Add helper functions to get analogue and digital pin states.


1.14 (2018-09-01)
-----------------

- Add ability to set the status of all pins through the C01 command.
- Add ability to set a single pin.
- Add pin range checking.
- Update stub processor to return the correct device model for firmware update testing.


1.13 (2018-08-12)
-----------------

- Add commands for restart of gps and restart of gsm.


1.12 (2018-08-08)
-----------------

- Add ability to recalculate leftover data, for use when changing parameters.


1.11 (2018-07-07)
-----------------

- Update TaxiData object to return strings rather than bytes.


1.10 (2018-07-07)
-----------------

- Implement C91 command to set device peripheral configuarion parameters.


1.9 (2018-06-16)
----------------

- Implement parser for taxi meter event (109).
- Update FC3 parsing as sometimes we get an extra field.


1.8 (2018-06-12)
----------------

- Fix bug when finding the eom '*' character when this can be present in binary payloads.
- Fix up parsing of FC1 responses when binary payload contains a comma in response fields.
- Implement FC2 parameters. The final field was missing causing a failure to move to the final stage of firmware download.
- Add FC3 back into workflow now all commands are running as expected.
- Firmware download is essentially working, the only missing step is verification of the checksum. At this time the checksum is ignored and the firmware is always marked as valid, resulting in always trying to update the firmware.


1.7 (2018-06-10)
----------------

- Implement firmware update processor
- Implement meitrack firmware commands FC0-FC7


1.6 (2018-06-04)
----------------

- Add support for setting the counter in the outbound message when converting to bytes and signing.
